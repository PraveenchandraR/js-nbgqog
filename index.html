      Question
      <p>
        You are required to sort an array of objects, where each student is
        represented as an object Each object has 4 keys, i.e, name, chemistry
        marks, biology marks, and date of birth. You should sort the array of
        objects according to the following rules: 1. The first priority is the
        total marks. 2. In case the students have the same total marks, the next
        priority should be the number of marks in biology. 3. If students have
        the same marks in biology, and chemistry and have the same date of
        birth, then any order between them is acceptable
